This is a project where I create a POS system for both Self CheckOut wich was the original idea and for cashiers. I wanted to make a lot of things with today's POS systems easier. Right now the project is very barebones and lack alot of the features that will be implemented at a later stage.

### Self CheckOut

9The goal is to make a easy self checkout system where the cosyumer has more ease of use than a lot of the systems that are in stores today. Like why can't I delete an item that I scanned a minute ago without the help from a cashier? Why can't you easily search for items? The category system in today's system is good for certain situations, but how about giving the user a search option to?

### POS Systems

33The POS systems also haves their flaws. They have more features, but they are often confusing and lack modern touches. Why can you search for an item only by pressing a physical button on the keyboard, and why is this a whole nother screen? My goal is to add this search field directly into the barcode field. This will make it much easier to add items more quickly.

### Technology

To make all of this happen I use a lot of different technologies. Here are some of the technology that is being used so far:
- Java
- Vaadin
- PostgreSQL
- Springframe
- Springframe Security

37This is a sideproject, and will take some time before it is complete, but is not intended to be built for buisness unless the project goes from a side project to a more seriouse project.
